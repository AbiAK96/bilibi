//! Observing a piece of work. Adapters (Axum for requests and live events, the
//! Queue for jobs) wrap their work with `Recorder::observe`; the work is
//! polled exactly as it would be without it, and the observation is handed to
//! `submit` afterwards, so nothing here can fail, wait or change the result.
